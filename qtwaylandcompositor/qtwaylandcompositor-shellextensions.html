<h1 class="title">Shell Extensions - Qt Wayland Compositor</h1>
<!-- $$$qtwaylandcompositor-shellextensions.html-description -->
<div class="descr" id="details">
<p>In Wayland, <i>shells</i> are extensions which provide <i>surface semantics</i>. This means that they provide ways for the server and client to communicate about surfaces. Surfaces, in this context, are often also referred to as &quot;windows&quot;, which is typically the representation of the surface in the compositor.</p>
<p>Shell extensions provide tools for the client and server to communicate about certain things:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can provide a way for the client to inform the server about the purpose of a surface: Is it a tool-tip, a pop-up menu, or a regular application window, for instance? Based on this, the server can decide on the geometry of the window and how the user can interact with it.</li>
<li>They can also provide protocols for manipulating the surface, such as resizing, moving, and hiding them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like other extensions, support for shells is added to a compositor by instantiating them as direct children of the <a href="qml-qtwayland-compositor-waylandcompositor.html">WaylandCompositor</a> top-level object. The shell extensions supported by Qt are: <a href="qml-wlshell.html">WlShell</a>, <a href="qml-xdgshell.html">XdgShell</a> and <a href="qml-iviapplication.html">IviApplication</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="qml-xdgshell.html">XdgShell</a> is an appropriate shell for desktop-style systems, where any number of applications can connect and where windows can be manually resized and repositioned by the user.</li>
<li><a href="qml-iviapplication.html">IviApplication</a> is a minimalistic protocol, originally intended for In-vehicle Infotainment systems. It is useful for embedded systems, where a pre-defined set of applications can run, often with pre-assigned screen real estate. For some more details on this protocol, see the <a href="qtwaylandcompositor-ivi-compositor-example.html">IVI Compositor example</a>.</li>
<li><a href="qml-wlshell.html">WlShell</a> is mostly useful for compatibility with third-party applications. This is also a desktop-style shell, but it has been deprecated and replaced by <a href="qml-xdgshell.html">XdgShell</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When designing an embedded system from the bottom up, there are no rules determining which shell extension to use. It will typically be either <a href="qml-xdgshell.html">XdgShell</a> or <a href="qml-iviapplication.html">IviApplication</a>. The decision should be influenced by what features the system will need, and whether there are applications involved which are not written in Qt and which have their own requirements.</p>
<p>A Qt Wayland Compositor can also support multiple shell extensions at once. See the <a href="qtwaylandcompositor-minimal-qml-example.html">Minimal QML example</a> for an example where all three shell extensions listed above are supported.</p>
