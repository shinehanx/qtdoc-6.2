<h1 class="title">Registering Products in Google Play</h1>
<!-- $$$qtpurchasing-googleplay.html-description -->
<div class="descr" id="details">
<p>The Google Play market place allows you to register your application, as well as the in-app products you want to make available to it, without publishing it. The following <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/publish">this guide</a> gives a brief introduction on uploading your application to Google Play and registering products.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-your-application-for-submission">Preparing your application for submission</h2>
<p>Before you can upload your application to Google Play, you must prepare it for submission.</p>
<h3 id="adding-a-manifest-xml">Adding a Manifest XML</h3>
<p>The default <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> generated for applications by Qt is suitable for development testing, but cannot be used when submitting the application to Google Play.</p>
<p>Create your own manifest by clicking the <b>Create Templates</b> button in Qt Creator. You can find the button under <b>Projects</b> &gt; <b>Build</b> tab. Expand <b>Build Android APK</b> to see it.</p>
<p>Once the manifest is added to your project, you can modify it. The most important parts are the <code>application name</code> and the <code>package name</code>. The package name must be unique, and it is recommended to follow the <b>com.mycompany.myappname</b> naming convention. The &quot;com.mycompany&quot; namespace is based on the internet domain ownership to avoid naming collisions with other applications.</p>
<p>Other important parts of the manifest include the <code>versionCode</code>, which must be incremented every time you upload a new version of the application. Other properties will decide how your application package is presented in the store listing, such as the <code>application name</code> and the <code>version name</code>.</p>
<p>For more information on the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>, see the <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element.html">Android documentation</a>.</p>
<p>For more information, refer to the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/android-3rdparty-libs.html">Third-party Android Libraries</a>.</p>
<h3 id="signing-the-application">Signing the application</h3>
<p>Qt uses the default debug key to sign your application to enable running the application on a device. Same key cannot be used to sign the Android Application Bundles that is meant to be published on Google Play.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-deploying-android.html#signing-android-packages">Signing Android Packages</a></p>
<h2 id="registering-your-application">Registering your application</h2>
<p>Once the application is prepared for publishing, you can create a listing for it in Google Play.</p>
<p>The first step is to get a publisher account, if you do not already have one. Go to <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/">the Google Play developer console</a>, log in with the Google account of your choice, and follow the steps as directed.</p>
<p>When you have set up your account, click on <b>Add new application</b> in Google Play's developer console.</p>
<p>Fill out as much information as you want in the store listing, and also the <b>Pricing and distribution</b> page.</p>
<h3 id="publishing-your-application">Publishing your application</h3>
<p>In order to test in-app purchases in your application, you first have to publish it.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/publish">Publish your app</a></p>
<h3 id="adding-in-app-products">Adding in-app products</h3>
<p>In order to access in-app products from your application, you must register them in Google Play.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/getting-ready#products">Create and configure your products</a></p>
