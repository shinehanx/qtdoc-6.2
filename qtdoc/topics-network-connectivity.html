<!-- $$$topics-network-connectivity.html-description -->
<div class="descr" id="details">
<p>Qt provides classes for both high-level and low-level network communication, classes for web integration, and classes for interprocess communication.</p>
<p>For high-level network traffic, <a href="../qtnetwork/qtnetwork-index.html">Qt Network</a> provides an abstraction layer over the operations used, showing only high-level classes and functions. Qt Network can also handle lower level protocols like TCP and UDP. Classes like <a href="../qtnetwork/qtcpsocket.html">QTcpSocket</a> and <a href="../qtnetwork/qudpsocket.html">QUdpSocket</a> enable the developer to send and receive messages using the TCP or UDP protocol.Name resolution is done with <a href="../qtnetwork/qhostinfo.html">QHostInfo</a>. <a href="../qtnetwork/qhostinfo.html">QHostInfo</a> is called before creating a network connection with <a href="../qtnetwork/qtcpsocket.html">QTcpSocket</a> or <a href="../qtnetwork/qudpsocket.html">QUdpSocket</a>. Filtering and redistributing network traffic via proxies can handled by the QNetWorkProxy class.</p>
<p>Qt also offers functionalities for <i>inter-process communication</i> (IPC). The class <a href="../qtcore/qprocess.html">QProcess</a> is used to start external programs. <a href="../qtdbus/qtdbus-index.html">Qt D-Bus</a> provides support for D-Bus, an interprocess communication and remoteprocedure calling mechanism. It mostly communicates via a central server application, called a bus. However, it is also possible to let applications communicate directly with each other. <a href="../qtcore/qsharedmemory.html">QSharedMemory</a> provides access to a shared memory segment by multiple threads and processes. It is however also possible for a single process to exclusively lock that shared memory.</p>
<h2 id="network-communication">Network Communication</h2>
<p>Qt supports a wide range of network communication, with a focus on HTTP, TCP, and UDP.</p>
<p>At the HTTP level, the <a href="../qtnetwork/qtnetwork-index.html">Qt Network</a> module offers the network access API, which consists mainly of <a href="../qtnetwork/qnetworkrequest.html">QNetworkRequest</a>, <a href="../qtnetwork/qnetworkaccessmanager.html">QNetworkAccessManager</a>, and <a href="../qtnetwork/qnetworkreply.html">QNetworkReply</a>. Put simply, the <a href="../qtnetwork/qnetworkrequest.html">QNetworkRequest</a> resembles an HTTP request, which gets passed to the <a href="../qtnetwork/qnetworkaccessmanager.html">QNetworkAccessManager</a> to send the request on the wire; this class returns a <a href="../qtnetwork/qnetworkreply.html">QNetworkReply</a>, which enables parsing the HTTP reply. The network access API uses the socket classes mentioned below (for TCP and SSL) internally.</p>
<p>For communication at the socket level, <a href="../qtnetwork/qtcpsocket.html">QTcpSocket</a>, <a href="../qtnetwork/qudpsocket.html">QUdpSocket</a> and <a href="../qtnetwork/qsslsocket.html">QSslSocket</a> should be used. These classes offer a synchronous API through the waitFor* methods as well as an asynchronous API; if possible (i.e&#x2e; if the event loop is running), the asynchronous API should always be preferred. Qt also offers <a href="../qtnetwork/qtcpserver.html">QTcpServer</a> to enable the server-side part of a TCP communication. Please note that there is no HTTP server class in Qt.</p>
<p>For secure communication via SSL, Qt Network offers a wide range of classes alongside the central <a href="../qtnetwork/qsslsocket.html">QSslSocket</a>, e.g&#x2e; <a href="../qtnetwork/qsslcertificate.html">QSslCertificate</a>, <a href="../qtnetwork/qsslconfiguration.html">QSslConfiguration</a> and <a href="../qtnetwork/qsslerror.html">QSslError</a>. The only supported backend for SSL in Qt is OpenSSL, which needs to be installed separately.</p>
<p>Qt also offers HTTP support in QML by either using HTTP explicitly via XmlHttpRequest, or by transparently using HTTP URLs in e.g&#x2e; Image sources.</p>

<h2 id="inter-process-communication">Inter-Process Communication</h2>
<p>Qt provides several ways to implement Inter-Process Communication (IPC) in Qt applications.</p>
<p>The cross-platform <a href="../qtnetwork/qtnetwork-index.html">Qt Network</a> module provides classes that make network programming portable and easy. It offers high-level classes (e.g&#x2e;, <a href="../qtnetwork/qnetworkaccessmanager.html">QNetworkAccessManager</a>) that communicate using specific application-level protocols, and lower-level classes (e.g&#x2e;, <a href="../qtnetwork/qtcpsocket.html">QTcpSocket</a>, <a href="../qtnetwork/qtcpserver.html">QTcpServer</a>, <a href="../qtnetwork/qsslsocket.html">QSslSocket</a>) for implementing protocols.</p>
<p>The cross-platform shared memory class, <a href="../qtcore/qsharedmemory.html">QSharedMemory</a>, provides access to the operating system's shared memory implementation. It allows safe access to shared memory segments by multiple threads and processes. Additionally, <a href="../qtcore/qsystemsemaphore.html">QSystemSemaphore</a> can be used to control access to resources shared by the system, as well as to communicate between processes.</p>
<p>The <a href="../qtdbus/qtdbus-index.html">Qt D-Bus</a> module is a cross-platform library you can use to implement IPC using the D-Bus protocol. It extends Qt's <a href="../qtcore/signalsandslots.html">signals and slots</a> mechanism to the IPC level, allowing a signal emitted by one process to be connected to a slot in another process.</p>
<p>The cross-platform class <a href="../qtcore/qprocess.html">QProcess</a> can be used to start external programs as child processes, and to communicate with them. It provides an API for monitoring and controlling the state of the child process. <a href="../qtcore/qprocess.html">QProcess</a> gives access to the input/output channels of child process by inheriting from <a href="../qtcore/qiodevice.html">QIODevice</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../qtnetwork/qlocalsocket.html">QLocalSocket</a> class provides a local socket. On Windows this is a named pipe and on Unix this is a local domain socket. The <a href="../qtnetwork/qlocalserver.html">QLocalServer</a> class provides a local socket based server. This class makes it possible to accept incoming local socket connections.</p>
