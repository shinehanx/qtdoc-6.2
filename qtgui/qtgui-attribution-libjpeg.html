 libjpeg-turbo Licenses
 ======================

 libjpeg-turbo is covered by three compatible BSD-style open source licenses:

 - The IJG (Independent JPEG Group) License, which is listed in
   [README.ijg](README.ijg)

   This license applies to the libjpeg API library and associated programs
   (any code inherited from libjpeg, and any modifications to that code.)

 - The Modified (3-clause) BSD License, which is listed below

   This license covers the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs, as
   well as the build system.

 - The [zlib License](https://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib)

   This license is a subset of the other two, and it covers the libjpeg-turbo
   SIMD extensions.


 Complying with the libjpeg-turbo Licenses
 =========================================

 This section provides a roll-up of the libjpeg-turbo licensing terms, to the
 best of our understanding.

 1.  If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source,
     then:

     1.  You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices
         from the source.

         **Origin**
         - Clause 1 of the IJG License
         - Clause 1 of the Modified BSD License
         - Clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License

     2.  You must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source
         file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file (if
         there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can
         simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)

         **Origin**
         - Clause 1 of the IJG License
         - Clause 2 of the zlib License

     3.  You must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the
         copyright or license text in that file.

         **Origin**
         - Clause 1 of the IJG License

 2.  If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or
     if you are distributing an application that statically links with
     libjpeg-turbo, then:

     1.  Your product documentation must include a message stating:

         This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG
         Group.

         **Origin**
         - Clause 2 of the IJG license

     2.  If your binary distribution includes or uses the TurboJPEG API, then
         your product documentation must include the text of the Modified BSD
         License (see below.)

         **Origin**
         - Clause 2 of the Modified BSD License

 3.  You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo Project or the
     contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.

     **Origin**
     - IJG License
     - Clause 3 of the Modified BSD License

 4.  The IJG and The libjpeg-turbo Project do not warrant libjpeg-turbo to be
     free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable
     consequences resulting from your use of the software.

     **Origin**
     - IJG License
     - Modified BSD License
     - zlib License

 Why Three Licenses?
 ===================

 The zlib License could have been used instead of the Modified (3-clause) BSD
 License, and since the IJG License effectively subsumes the distribution
 conditions of the zlib License, this would have effectively placed
 libjpeg-turbo binary distributions under the IJG License.  However, the IJG
 License specifically refers to the Independent JPEG Group and does not extend
 attribution and endorsement protections to other entities.  Thus, it was
 desirable to choose a license that granted us the same protections for new code
 that were granted to the IJG for code derived from their software.
